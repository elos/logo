Logo
====

Like the logo? It was mathematically generated by the files in this repo.
The relevent code is in the file called `logo.pde`. You can edit the code
in that file and then load `index.html` in a web browser to render the
result into a `canvas` element. From there, to save as an image, just
type `transfer()` into the javascript console to render the data to an
image, which you can right-click and save-as to do whatever your heart
desires.
